                        <p>
                             I’m so happy, and I hope it’s really you. Being with you fills me with joy,
                            even though this month has been tough with all the tears. But it’s okay,
                            I understand you, and I’ll always be here for you. I’ll never leave.
                            I still can’t believe I have you. You were like a 0.01% chance of winning,
                            I still wonder if this is real. I don’t know what I did to deserve a goddess like you.
                            It’s getting closer to the time when we’ll live every day together, making memories.
                            I’ve wanted you to be my wife since the day we met. Since then,
                            I’ve never been sad you’ve brought color to my life, even on rainy days. 
                            I’m so excited for our anniversary.
                            I love you so much!
